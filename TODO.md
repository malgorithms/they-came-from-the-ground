### Quicker and easier than Github issues for now

Stuff

- consider horizontal dash move
- more characters?
- yellow player who likes to catch the ball
- managed to force the ball throug the net once - add constraint
- menu redesign:
  - hmm, maybe consider grid of them rather than stacking
  - bot template support
    - disabled but visible with explanation you can write your own
    - activated as soon as you edit something like myBot.ts
- sharing idea: stats page with info in URL!
- firefox on mac:
  - controller lag
  - button mappings different from chrome & safari
  - fps sucks
  - warning when controller connected, if bugs not fixable
- performance:
  - font drawing: draw fonts onto separate cached canvases and then project
    - them onto the game canvas
  - consider no clouds on slow framerate
  - check if not drawing off-screen clouds affects things
  - test on old iMac
  - explore higher physicsDt / predictionDt
- better intro with them emerging from the ground, possibly launching debris
- sound improvements:
  - ball hitting ground sound
  - if ball bounces in rapid succession (fast volley?) pitch increases
  - fix ding off flower...too bell-like, echoey.
  - better sound for growth/shrinking
- exiting game shouldn't cause reload

Before launching

- discord to discuss
- proper readme page for github
- review all console logging
- basic SEO of landing page
- basic pageview stats?
- better favicon / larger ones for bookmarking
