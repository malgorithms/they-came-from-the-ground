### Quicker and easier than Github issues for now

Stuff

- more characters?
- managed to force the ball through the net once - add constraint
- menu redesign:
  - it's all too mingled. Need to separate:
    - exit / return to game
    - play 1 player
    - play 2 player
- sharing idea: stats page with info in URL!
- firefox on mac:
  - controller lag
  - button mappings different from chrome & safari
  - fps sucks
  - warning when controller connected, if bugs not fixable
- performance:
  - explore higher physicsDt / predictionDt
  - consider no clouds on slow framerate
  - test on old iMac
- better intro ideas
  - all of them emerging from the ground and looking at character next to them
  - ball follows them out and they watch that
  - they jump back into the ground?
- sound improvements:
- exiting game shouldn't cause reload
- iOS - can I make it work?!

Before launching

- discord to discuss
- proper readme page for github
- review all console logging
- basic SEO of landing page
- basic pageview stats?
- better favicon / larger ones for bookmarking
