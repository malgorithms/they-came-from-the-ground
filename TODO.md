### Quicker and easier than Github issues for now

Stuff

- ding nose off flowers is too echo-y
- make clouds more like moon; parallax
- test MS Edge
- code quality and technical debt:
  - move all hard-coded constants into existing tweakables.ts. What a mess.
  - clean up all the player and playerconfig iterations in game.ts
- firefox:
  - controller lag
  - button mappings different from chrome & safari
  - fps sucks
  - warning when controller connected, if bugs not fixable
- controller work:
  - autopause on disconnect
- performance:
  - consider no clouds on slow framerate
  - check if not drawing off-screen clouds affects things
  - consider separate timer on re-drawing
  - profile JS
- changing size sound persists if game pauses/ends while size changing
- test on old iMac
- make work on iPad
- warning when on mobile device
- slam sprite flickers back to life at end
- give characters names
- on two player game against white, both balls going in hole on the right
- unlock AI's by beating previous; display of which unlocked
- include full-screen launch
- make the debug view prettier
- better intro with them emerging from the ground, possibly launching debris
- switch drawing players to pure canvas actions? might make for more creative additions/eyes/etc.
- breathe in/out sounds when growing/shrinking

Before launching

- better landing page
- discord to discuss
- proper readme page for github
- review all console logging
- basic SEO of landing page
- basic pageview stats?
